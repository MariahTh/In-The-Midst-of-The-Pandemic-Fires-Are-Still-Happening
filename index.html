      <p>As the fear of a second wave leads to city offcials ending in-door dining indefinetely, many other issues are being overlooked. One issue that annually occurs during this time are house fires. According to <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance">data</a>, house fire property loss claims are some of the "most common and expensive in the United States." Based on the <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/statistics/#where">United States Fire Administration</a>, residential buildings are leading when it comes to fire deaths, injury, and property loss. With Christmas approaching, fires are expected to increase this holiday season. </p>


<p>    Back in <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Seasonal-fire-causes/Winter-holidays/Holiday-fires-by-the-numbers">2018,</a> Electrical distribution or lighting equipment was involved in 45% of home Christmas tree fires.    During the pandemic, <a href="https://www.nycfirewire.net/">NYC Fire Wire,</a> a platform started in 2012, posts NYC house fires daily. Major coronavirus hotspots in New York City are constantly suffering from house fires during this time. With the hope for a cheerful Christmas, a decrease in fires caused by Christmas trees would be a major impact. According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-christmas-trees-can-help-end-a-difficult-year-with-good-memories-301160190.html">Christmas Tree Promotion Board, </a>  39 percent of people they spoke with said they're more likely to buy a real Christmas tree simply because of the pandemic.  </p>

  "Havng a Christmas Tree is helping us de-stress a bit from everything going on," said Eula Gilliam, a Brooklyn-based Christmas enthusiast who already set up and decorated her tree earlier in the month. "I wasn't aware of how big the impact our Christmas trees can have on house fires until you showed me some data."

     Despite the panemic's ongoing threat, Christmas is meant for joy. Only this time, the holidays will look different than normal.
